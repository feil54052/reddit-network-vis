GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

You can run the existing test-suite via `rake`.  Ensure nothing is broken, but since the test since is far from complete, it'd be awesome if you manually tested for regressions as well.

Please, if at all possible, write a passing test for the functionality you added.
